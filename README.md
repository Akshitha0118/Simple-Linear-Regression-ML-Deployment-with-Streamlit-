# 📈 Salary Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python to predict employee salary based on years of experience. It integrates machine learning with statistical analysis, providing both predictive modeling and descriptive statistics for deeper insights.


# 🧠 Objective

* Build a linear regression model to predict salary.

* Visualize the relationship between Years of Experience and Salary.

* Perform statistical analysis to validate data behavior.

* Evaluate model performance using R² score, bias, and variance.

* Save the trained model using Pickle for future deployment.


# 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python

* Pandas – Data handling

* NumPy – Numerical operations

* Scikit-learn – Model building & evaluation

* Matplotlib – Data visualization

* SciPy – Statistical analysis

* Pickle – Model serialization


# 📂 Dataset

* Salary_Data.csv

* Features:

* YearsExperience (Independent Variable)

* Salary (Dependent Variable)


# ⚙️ Workflow

* Import required libraries

* Load and explore the dataset

* Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

* Train a Linear Regression model

* Visualize regression results

* Perform future salary predictions (12 & 20 years experience)

* Apply statistical measures:

* Mean, Median, Mode

* Variance & Standard Deviation

* Coefficient of Variation

* Correlation & Skewness

* Z-score Standardization

# Compute:

* SSR, SSE, SST

* R² Score

* Bias & Variance

* Save trained model using Pickle


# 📊 Model Visualization

* Scatter plot of test data

* Regression line from training data

* Clear interpretation of salary trends


# 📈 Model Evaluation

* R² Score for performance accuracy

* Bias score using training data

* Variance score using test data


# 🔮 Future Predictions

* Salary prediction for:

* 12 years of experience

* 20 years of experience


# 💾 Model Deployment Ready

* Trained model serialized as:

* Linear_regression_model.pkl


* Can be reused in web apps (Flask / Streamlit)


# 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes

* Understanding Simple Linear Regression

* Practical use of statistical concepts in ML

* Model evaluation & interpretation

* Real-world prediction logic

* Model persistence using Pickle
